4090,2021-11-17 17:10:46+00:00,Mr_Ceyram,What the tollbooths generate annually is far lesser than what the E-Levy is projected to generate. There is nothing to celebrate about this except for those who will be in charge and mismanage these funds. God save Ghana. #Budget2022
4091,2021-11-17 16:18:02+00:00,nanakgyesi1,"Now the about 2.4M tax payers will have their fellow compatriots join them through E-Levy. If about 30M pay tax, our revenue expands.  
This is not to overburden the poor or ordinary Ghanaian but reduce our year &amp; year deficit. 
It's in our best interest.

4092,2021-11-17 16:15:57+00:00,AaronOsagyefo,"If what is reported about the ""e-levy"" is accurate, then:

2019 - About GHc 2M was raised from tollbooths

2020 - Total Momo transactions was GHc 571 Billion.

If we apply the 1.7% levy rate to that amount, we have GHc 9.9 Billion.

From 2M to 10B

I hope roads get fixed.

4096,2021-11-17 15:11:49+00:00,DohKafui1,"Telco transaction cost - 1%
E-Levy - 1.75%
*Total 2.75%*

Sending from one network to another 
Telco transaction cost - 1.75%
E-Levy -1.75%
*Total - 3.5%*

This is the total percentage you will pay on momo transactions going forward.
